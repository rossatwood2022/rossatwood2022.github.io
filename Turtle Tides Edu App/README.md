## Privacy Notice
This project was developed for CS 3500 - Software Practice II, and the code was deliberately not made public to follow academic conduct. A live demo of this project could be done if requested.

## Application Description
This educational application is a game where the player navigates the stages of a turtle's life. It's primary focus is to educate players about the growing concerns of climate change and pollution through relevant facts and clever gameplay features (see below). The estimated cumulative time developing this application was 120+ hours. 

## About the Development 
Planning and development took place in the format of Scrum. Every meeting had a Scrum subsection where we answered three simple questions about our individual progress and goals. Team members were assigned (or volunteered for) small pieces of the application and were able to collaborate or ask for help with their tasks. We did the majority of the work across three sprints in a 2.5 week span. All of the artwork was done by hand in a sprite editor.

## About the Research
