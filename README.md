# Project portfolio, Ross Milo Atwood
This repository contains demos and codebases of projects that I have developed throughout the course of my career. Click any project folders to see a showcase of the application's functionality! Github may require you to download the .mp4 file to view the video, hopefully it just displays the demos within the directories. Thank you for visiting :)

## Privacy notice
Some projects are protected by the University of Utah and code/solutions should not be shown for the sake of good academic practice. If desired a live demonstration of any application could be performed.
